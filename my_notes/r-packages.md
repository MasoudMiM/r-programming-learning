1. **Introduction:** <a name="intro"></a>
  
    Managing packages in R is crucial for expanding functionality and accessing additional tools. Packages enhance R's capabilities by providing specialized functions and datasets.

    Proper management of packages is essential for efficient and effective R programming. Always ensure packages are installed, loaded, and used appropriately to avoid errors and conflicts.

2. **Installing Packages:** <a name="install-packages"></a>
  
    Use `install.packages("packageName")` to install packages in R. RStudio prompts installation if the package is not already installed.
  
    Example:
    ```R
    install.packages("pacman")
    ```

3. **Loading Packages:** <a name="loading-packages"></a>
  
    Load packages using `library(packageName)` or `require(packageName)`:
  
    - library() gives an error if the package is not installed, stopping execution.
    - require() gives a warning but continues execution.

      Example:
      ```R
      library(pacman)
      ```

4. **Using Functions Without Loading Packages:** <a name="using-functions"></a>
  
    Use package::functionName syntax to use specific functions without loading the entire package. Helpful when dealing with conflicting function names or when only specific functions are needed.

      ```R
      pacman::p_data(datasets)
      ```

5. **Unloading and Deleting Packages** <a name="unload-packages"></a>

    Unload a package with detach("package:packageName", unload = TRUE).

    - Manual unloading is typically needed only for R's built-in packages.
    - For third-party packages like pacman, restarting R will unload them.

    You can completely remove a package from the library with `remove.packages("packageName")`.

    Example:
    ```R
    remove.packages("pacman")
    ```
    
    **Note:** This function does not remove dependencies installed with the package.
